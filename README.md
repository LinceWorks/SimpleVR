## SimpleVR capabilities

SimpleVR is a lightweight framework for Unity3D that solves common issues and features every VR game needs.

Main features:
* Locomotion and Teleportation
* Object Manipulation
* Management of walls and obstructions
* Support SteamVR Input system
* ...

It uses SteamVR plugin only to support its input system. You can map interactions with VR controllers with its editor.

### Sample images and gifs

*Note: When you read about walls, it means something that has a collider but not physics simulation (not RigidBody).*

- Locomotion (with joystick and head movement working together)
  - Example of head movement:
    - ![move_body](ReadmeData/move_body.gif)
- Easy teleport setup
  - CharacterVR class public methods:
    - MoveTo
    - SetPosition
    - LookAt
    - SetRotation
    - SetRotation
    - SetYawRotation
    - AddYawRotation
    - Rotate
- Capsule and sphere **Interactable** detection
  - Interactable and Grabbables (inherits from Interactable) can be:
    - Ethereal: detectable through walls
    - Constrained Detection: Can't detect with capsule, only sphere
    - Undetectable: Can't be detected (can't interact with)
- Attachment points for Grabbable gameObjects (don't depend on the pivot of the object to grab it)
  - ![attachment_point](ReadmeData/attachment_point.gif)
- Fade to black next to walls (depends on the direction player is looking at)
  - ![fade_next_wall](ReadmeData/fade_next_wall.gif)
- Can't grab objects through walls, even can't push objects through walls with hands or other objects, can't release object until it is outside a wall.
  - ![wall_interactables](ReadmeData/wall_interactables.gif)
  - can't grab the object until player moves to the other side of the wall
  - ![wall_interactables_2](ReadmeData/wall_interactables_2.gif)
- Slots to store your objects
  - ![slots](ReadmeData/slots.gif)
  - Different slot types (Slot and Grabbable must match their Attachment Type Name to interact) and a slot can't have an Initial Grabbable (instantiates a Grabbable object on Start)
    - ![Slot](ReadmeData/Slot.PNG)
    - ![Grabbable](ReadmeData/Grabbable.PNG)
- Linear Drive with positions and animations (**Auto Return** option: 1st drawer and animated cube)
  - ![linear_drive](ReadmeData/linear_drive.gif)
- Easy config with ScriptableObjects
  - ![DataVR](ReadmeData/DataVR.PNG)
  - ![HandVRConstants](ReadmeData/HandVRConstants.PNG)
  - ![GrabbableConstants](ReadmeData/GrabbableConstants.PNG)

## Instructions

Download and open SimpleVR project with Unity 2018.3+

Download **SimpleVR Dependencies** (links below) and place them on Assets/Plugins folder (except SteamVR, it goes inside Assets folder directly).

Download **SimpleVR.Example dependencies** and **Recommended plugins** too, place them inside Assets/Plugins.

**IMPORTANT:** Probably you'll notice some errors at this point, continue with the tutorial and they will be fixed.

Since 2018.3, **UnityEngine.SpatialTracking** namespace (which is needed by SimpleVR) has been moved to a package.

To install it (or update it) go to *Window > Package Manager* and in *Packages* window, select *All packages > XR Legacy Input Helpers* and **install** or **update**.

![package_manager](ReadmeData/package_manager.gif)

Create an **Assembly Definition** for QuickOutline plugin and SuperScience plugin:

- Right click on the QuickOutline folder and SuperScience folder in the Project window, *Create > Assembly Definition*.

![create_Assembly](ReadmeData/create_assembly.gif)

Add the **Assembly Definition Reference** of *UnityEngine.SpatialTracking* (no the UnityEditor.SpatialTracking) to the **SuperScience** assembly definition and **Apply**.

![assembly_definition_reference](ReadmeData/assembly_definition_reference.gif)

Add assembly definitions to **SimpleVR** assembly, the same way, until it looks like:

![simplevr_assembly_references](ReadmeData/simplevr_assembly_references.PNG)

Be sure that LeftHand and RightHand gameObjects in CharacterVR.prefab have PoseProvider component and copy the Tunnelling component data as seen in the image to the camera gameObject.

![tunnelling](ReadmeData/tunnelling.PNG)

After that, everything should be ok. If not, restart Unity Editor.

## SimpleVR dependencies

- SteamVR (included in the project) [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin)
- SuperScience https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/SuperScience
  - GizmoModule
  - PhysicsTracker
- DOTween: Translate Grabbable on attach. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676

## SimpleVR.Example dependencies

InteractableFeedback.cs needs:

- Quick Outline [https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/quick-outline-115488](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/quick-outline-115488)

## Recommended plugins

- VR Tunnelling Pro [https://github.com/sigtrapgames/VrTunnellingPro-Unity](https://github.com/sigtrapgames/VrTunnellingPro-Unity)
  - If missing, there will be a missing script in **CharacterVR** prefab's camera.
